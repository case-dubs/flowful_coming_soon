                        <p>I was doing a lot of what I thought I <i>“SHOULD" </i>  be doing and not enough of what energized me. And, then I made Flowful to find out more about myself. After a hiatus, when I reverted back to my old habits of doing what I <i>“SHOULD" </i>  be doing, I realized that THIS was what I really WANTED to do. So, I re-thought what really energized me and am diving head-first into building this tool.</p>
                        <p>Flowful can help individuals eager to learn more about themselves. And, I have a feeling that it will be even more powerful in conjunction with therapists and coaches who can work with their clients to interpret their results and leverage their findings to make positive life changes.</p>
